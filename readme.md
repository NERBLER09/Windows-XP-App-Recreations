# Recreating Windows XP Applications 

## About
This is a mono repo containing recreations of some Windows XP apps.

Note: This is not to recreate the entirety of Windows XP and not all apps will be recreated or made.

Every app is made with Electron, but the more complex is made with React and Electron

## Setup 
Clone the repo and `cd ` into it. See `Folders` to see what each folder contains. `cd` into that folder and run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

## Folders 
- `oobe` Contains a recreation of the Windows XP OOBE
- `ms-paint` Contains a recreation of the Windows XP Paint
- `notepad` Contains a recreation of the Windows XP Notepad

## Contributing 
Generally open an issue (or comment on an issue if there's one already) before starting work on a PR.

When creating an issue or feature request state what app you're talking about by the folder name.
`[folder name] - [issue/feature request]`

Eg, `OOBE - Adding title.wma`
